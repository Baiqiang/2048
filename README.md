2048
====

The [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game is very popular. So I made some 2048, based on the original one.

1. [Double 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-double/)
   This version contains two game areas. Getting any one to the 2048 tile to win.
2. [Cross 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-cross/)
   This version also contains two game areas, which have a common tile. It's easier than the double version.
3. [Cross 2048 2](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-cross2/)
   Another version of cross 2048. The two game areas have 4 common tiles.
4. [Hexagonal 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-hexagon/)
   I changed the container to haxagon. Use combined keys to move, such as W and A to move left top. Q, E, Z and C are the short cuts.
5. [Hexagonal 2048 2](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-hexagon2/)
   Left is left and right is right. But what up is up left or up right depends on the last horizontal move.
