{"name":"2048","tagline":"","body":"2048\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game is very popular. So I made some 2048, based on the original one.\r\n\r\n1. [Double 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-double/)\r\n   This version contains two game areas. Getting any one to the 2048 tile to win.\r\n2. [Cross 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-cross/)\r\n   This version also contains two game areas, which have a common tile. It's easier than the double version.\r\n3. [Cross 2048 2](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-cross2/)\r\n   Another version of cross 2048. The two game areas have 4 common tiles.\r\n4. [Hexagonal 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-hexagon/)\r\n   I changed the container to haxagon. Use combined keys to move, such as W and A to move left top. Q, E, Z and C are the short cuts.\r\n5. [Hexagonal 2048 2](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-hexagon2/)\r\n   Left is left and right is right. But what up is up left or up right depends on the last horizontal move.\r\n","google":"UA-3512083-5","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
